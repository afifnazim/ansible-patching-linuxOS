The tasks which needs to be performed everyday or on a regular basis should be automated. By doing that we can save time for other important tasks.

Linux Server Patching is one of those tasks which a System Administrators or DevOps Engineers does on a regular basis on onprem servers, cloud or on the virtualized servers.

By using ansible we can seamlessly make the updates without even loggin in to the remote servers.
